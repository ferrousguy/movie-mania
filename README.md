# Movie Mania

This project supports the video tutorial for integrating the Adapty iOS SDK into a SwiftUI app. Please see the instructions below to get started.

## Setup

Clone this repository and if you wish to follow along with the video, switch to the **starter** branch to use the version of the project without any Adapty integration.

Feel free to use the **main** branch at any time to compare your progress with the finished project.

## Running the Finished Project

If you wish to use the finished project as-is, you'll need to prepare a few things:

* Add your Adapty SDK key to the _Constants.swift_ file.
* Configure the Xcode project to use your Apple Developer team.
* Go into your Adapty dashboard and set up at least 1 product, 1 paywall, and 1 placement. See the tutorial video starting at 18:20 for information on configuring these items.

* Once the above steps are complete, the finished Xcode project in the **main** branch should function and allow you to test the paywall functionality.
